The render delay you're experiencing (around 10 seconds) is likely due to the following bottlenecks in your Schedule9CProvisionTable component:

Performance Bottlenecks

1. Heavy useEffect during mount:

The fetchData() function is doing synchronous work like transforming and iterating over a large config (rowDefinitionsConfig) and Object.entries(response).

This blocking logic happens before the UI renders.



2. Expensive useMemo for calculatedData:

It recomputes values for every formData change and calculates multiple derived columns for dozens of rows.



3. Rendering hundreds of <FormInput> components:

Each editable row renders up to 18 columns = ~200+ components if ~10 rows.

Without virtualization, MUI + styled components + custom FormInput is heavy.



4. Synchronous validations in useEffect:

Validating all totals on every render adds to delay.

Recommended Code Improvements

Here are targeted changes to drastically improve performance:


---

1. Defer transformation after initial render

Split fetchData into two steps:

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    const response = await callApi('/Maker/getSavedDataNineC', requestPayload, 'POST');
    setRawApiData(response); // defer processing
    setIsLoading(false);
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);

Then transform:

useEffect(() => {
  if (!rawApiData) return;

  const transformed = transformApiData(rawApiData);
  setFormData(transformed);
}, [rawApiData]);


---

2. Debounce table rendering using lazy rendering or virtualization

Replace direct table rendering with react-window or limit row count at a time:

<TableBody>
  {visibleRows.map(...) // limit to ~20 rows initially, add 'Load More' if needed
</TableBody>


---

3. Optimize useMemo for calculatedData

Avoid computing derived values if underlying formData hasn't changed per row:

useMemo(() => {
  // Instead of all rows, compute only changed row or cache row calculations
}, [formData])

You could even cache row-level computed values using a useRef() + shallowEqual strategy.


---

4. Lazy-validate only on Submit (optional)

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const errors = validateTotals(calculatedData);
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    setValidationErrors(errors);
    return;
  }
  // continue submission
};

Remove the real-time validation useEffect.

Summary of Code Enhancements

Area	Action

API call	Split into fetch + transform phases
Rendering	Use virtualization or lazy-load rows
useMemo	Reduce recalculations or scope them
Validation	Move from realtime to submit-time
UI Snappiness	Render skeleton/loader immediately, defer heavy logic


Let me know if you want me to modify your existing code with these optimizations.
