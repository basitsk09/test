Sure, let's compile a comprehensive list of Spring Boot interview questions and answers, tailored to what Infosys might look for, given their focus on large-scale enterprise applications, microservices, cloud, and modern development practices.
I'll categorize them for clarity, provide detailed explanations, and offer sample answers.
Infosys Spring Boot Interview Questions & Answers
Infosys typically looks for candidates with strong fundamentals, practical experience in building scalable applications, problem-solving skills, and a good understanding of modern architectural patterns.
Category 1: Core Spring Boot Concepts
These questions assess your foundational knowledge of Spring Boot.
1. Q: What is Spring Boot and what are its main advantages over traditional Spring Framework development?
A: Spring Boot is an opinionated, convention-over-configuration framework built on top of the Spring Framework. Its primary goal is to simplify the development of production-ready Spring applications by minimizing boilerplate code and configuration.
Advantages over traditional Spring:
 * Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures your Spring application based on the JARs present in the classpath. For example, if you have spring-webmvc and tomcat on the classpath, it auto-configures a DispatcherServlet and an embedded Tomcat server. This drastically reduces manual configuration (XML or Java config).
 * Embedded Servers: Ships with embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, eliminating the need for a separate WAR deployment to an external application server. You can run java -jar your-app.jar.
 * Starters: Provides "starter" dependencies (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa) that aggregate common dependencies, simplifying build configuration and ensuring compatible versions.
 * No XML Configuration: Promotes convention over configuration, significantly reducing or eliminating the need for XML configuration.
 * Production-Ready Features: Includes out-of-the-box features like health checks, metrics, externalized configuration, and security via Spring Boot Actuator, simplifying operational aspects.
 * Stand-alone Applications: Allows creating standalone, runnable JARs that can be easily deployed.
2. Q: Explain the purpose of @SpringBootApplication annotation. What annotations does it meta-annotate?
A: @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that marks the main class of a Spring Boot application. It's a composite annotation that combines three key annotations:
 * @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring IoC container. This means you can declare @Bean methods within this class.
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. This is where the "magic" of auto-configuration happens. For instance, if you have H2 database on the classpath, it will auto-configure an in-memory H2 database.
 * @ComponentScan: Instructs Spring to scan for components (like @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) in the current package and its sub-packages, automatically discovering and registering them as Spring beans.
Why it's useful: It centralizes the core configuration and component scanning setup in a single, clear annotation, making the main application class concise.
3. Q: How does Spring Boot's auto-configuration work internally?
A: Spring Boot's auto-configuration is driven by the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation and a sophisticated mechanism of conditional annotations.
 * spring.factories: Spring Boot looks for META-INF/spring.factories files in JARs on the classpath. These files contain a list of auto-configuration classes to be considered.
 * Conditional Annotations: Each auto-configuration class (e.g., DataSourceAutoConfiguration, WebMvcAutoConfiguration) is typically annotated with @ConditionalOnClass, @ConditionalOnMissingBean, @ConditionalOnProperty, etc.
   * @ConditionalOnClass: Configures a bean only if a particular class is present on the classpath.
   * @ConditionalOnMissingBean: Configures a bean only if a bean of a specific type is not already defined by the user. This allows user-defined beans to override auto-configurations.
   * @ConditionalOnProperty: Configures a bean only if a specific Spring property is set to a certain value.
   * @ConditionalOnWebApplication, @ConditionalOnNotWebApplication: Configures based on whether it's a web application.
 * Order of Application: Auto-configurations are applied in a specific order, allowing one configuration to depend on or override another.
This mechanism ensures that only relevant configurations are applied, and user-defined configurations always take precedence.
4. Q: What are Spring Boot Starters? Give an example.
A: Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They are designed to simplify Maven/Gradle build configuration by providing a "one-stop-shop" for all the dependencies you need for a particular feature.
Instead of manually adding individual dependencies (e.g., Spring MVC, Jackson, Tomcat for a web app), a Starter aggregates them. This ensures:
 * Simplified Dependency Management: You don't have to worry about compatible versions of libraries.
 * Consistent Builds: All projects using the same starter get the same set of transitive dependencies.
Example:
 * spring-boot-starter-web: This starter includes everything needed for a web application, including Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat, Jackson (for JSON), validation, etc.
 * spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Includes Spring Data JPA, Hibernate (ORM), and embedded database support.
 * spring-boot-starter-test: Includes Spring Test, JUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest, and AssertJ for testing.
5. Q: How do you externalize configuration in Spring Boot? Why is it important?
A: Externalizing configuration means separating configuration settings (like database URLs, API keys, port numbers) from the application's code.
Why it's important:
 * Environment Agnostic Deployment: Allows the same application artifact (JAR/WAR) to be deployed across different environments (dev, test, prod) without recompilation.
 * Security: Keeps sensitive information out of the codebase.
 * Flexibility: Enables quick changes to application behavior without code modification or redeployment.
Methods in Spring Boot (in order of precedence):
 * Command Line Arguments: --server.port=8081
 * OS Environment Variables: SERVER_PORT=8081
 * Profile-specific application-{profile}.properties/yml: application-dev.properties, application-prod.yml
 * application.properties/yml (packed in JAR): Default properties.
 * Programmatic Configuration: Using SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties().
 * Spring Cloud Config Server: For distributed systems, a dedicated configuration server.
Spring Boot uses a very specific order of precedence for loading properties, with command-line arguments overriding environment variables, which override application.properties, and so on.
6. Q: What is Spring Boot Actuator? What are its common endpoints?
A: Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application when it's running in production. It exposes operational information about the running application, like health, metrics, info, and environment properties.
Common Endpoints:
 * /actuator/health: Shows application health information (UP/DOWN, database connectivity, disk space, etc.).
 * /actuator/info: Displays arbitrary application information.
 * /actuator/metrics: Provides detailed metrics about the JVM, CPU, Tomcat, HTTP requests, etc.
 * /actuator/env: Exposes environment properties (system properties, environment variables, application.properties values).
 * /actuator/beans: Displays a complete list of all Spring beans in the application context.
 * /actuator/mappings: Shows a list of all @RequestMapping paths.
 * /actuator/loggers: Allows inspecting and changing the logging level of the application at runtime.
Security Note: For security, most Actuator endpoints are not exposed over HTTP by default in production. You typically expose them via JMX or selectively expose specific endpoints over HTTP.
Category 2: Spring Boot with Microservices
Infosys heavily focuses on microservices architecture. These questions delve into that area.
1. Q: How does Spring Boot facilitate building microservices?
A: Spring Boot is an ideal choice for building microservices due to several features:
 * Rapid Development: Auto-configuration, starters, and embedded servers allow developers to quickly spin up small, independent services.
 * Standalone JARs: Microservices are typically deployed as self-contained units. Spring Boot's executable JARs are perfect for this.
 * Simplified Configuration: Externalized configuration and profiles make it easy to manage configurations for different microservices and environments.
 * Actuator: Provides built-in monitoring and management capabilities crucial for distributed microservice environments.
 * Integration with Spring Cloud: Spring Boot seamlessly integrates with Spring Cloud projects (e.g., Eureka for service discovery, Hystrix/Resilience4j for circuit breakers, Feign for declarative REST clients, Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration), which are essential for robust microservices.
 * Developer Productivity: Reduces boilerplate, allowing developers to focus on business logic for individual services.
2. Q: What are some common challenges in microservices architecture and how can Spring Boot/Spring Cloud help address them?
A:
 * Service Discovery: How do services find each other?
   * Spring Cloud Eureka (Netflix Eureka): A service registry that microservices register with and discover each other from.
 * Centralized Configuration: How to manage configuration for hundreds of services?
   * Spring Cloud Config Server: Provides a centralized, version-controlled (e.g., Git-backed) configuration repository that services can pull from.
 * Inter-service Communication: How do services communicate reliably?
   * Spring Cloud OpenFeign: Simplifies REST client creation with declarative interfaces.
   * Spring Kafka/RabbitMQ: For asynchronous, event-driven communication.
 * Fault Tolerance/Resilience: What happens if a service fails or is slow?
   * Spring Cloud Resilience4j (formerly Netflix Hystrix): Provides circuit breakers, retries, and bulkhead patterns to prevent cascading failures.
 * Distributed Tracing: How to trace a request across multiple services?
   * Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin/OpenTelemetry: Adds correlation IDs to logs and integrates with tracing systems.
 * API Gateway: How to provide a single entry point for external clients?
   * Spring Cloud Gateway (or Netflix Zuul): A reverse proxy that handles routing, security, rate limiting, etc.
 * Data Consistency: How to maintain consistency across distributed databases?
   * Eventual Consistency, Saga Pattern: These are architectural patterns often implemented with message brokers like Kafka.
 * Monitoring & Logging: How to monitor the health and performance of many services?
   * Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus/Grafana/ELK Stack: Actuator provides metrics/health; tools like Prometheus and ELK stack gather and visualize them.
3. Q: Explain the concept of a Circuit Breaker pattern in microservices. Which Spring Cloud project implements it?
A: The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used in microservices to improve the resilience and fault tolerance of an application. It prevents a cascading failure by automatically stopping remote calls to a service that is repeatedly failing or timing out.
How it works:
 * Closed State: Normal operation. Calls to the external service are allowed. If failures exceed a threshold, it transitions to Open.
 * Open State: Calls to the external service are immediately rejected (fail fast) without attempting to reach the failing service. A fallback method is executed, or an error is returned. After a configurable timeout, it transitions to Half-Open.
 * Half-Open State: A few trial calls are allowed to the external service. If these succeed, it transitions back to Closed. If they fail, it transitions back to Open.
Implementation:
 * Spring Cloud Resilience4j: This is the current recommended library in Spring Cloud for implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern (and other resilience patterns like Rate Limiter, Bulkhead). It's a lightweight, functional, and performance-oriented fault tolerance library.
 * (Historically, Netflix Hystrix was used, but it's now in maintenance mode).
4. Q: How would you implement inter-service communication in a Spring Boot microservice architecture? Compare synchronous and asynchronous approaches.
A:
 * Synchronous Communication (e.g., REST over HTTP):
   * How: Services call each other directly using REST APIs.
   * Spring Boot/Cloud tools: RestTemplate, WebClient (reactive), Spring Cloud OpenFeign (declarative HTTP client).
   * Pros: Simpler to implement for basic request-response, immediate feedback, easy to debug (single call stack).
   * Cons: Tight coupling (requester depends on responder availability), blocking calls (can lead to performance issues), cascading failures, difficult for fan-out scenarios.
   * Use Cases: Request-response interactions where immediate data is needed (e.g., "get user profile").
 * Asynchronous Communication (e.g., Message Queues/Event Streams):
   * How: Services communicate by publishing and subscribing to messages/events via a message broker (like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ).
   * Spring Boot/Cloud tools: Spring for Apache Kafka, Spring AMQP (for RabbitMQ).
   * Pros: Loose coupling (sender and receiver don't need to know about each other or be online simultaneously), higher scalability and resilience, supports fan-out, enables eventual consistency, forms an audit log.
   * Cons: Increased complexity (managing brokers, eventual consistency models), harder to trace end-to-end flows, no immediate response.
   * Use Cases: Event-driven architectures, notification systems, log aggregation, data pipelines, long-running processes, preventing cascading failures.
Recommendation for Infosys: Emphasize that a hybrid approach is often best: synchronous for critical, immediate interactions, and asynchronous for everything else to maximize decoupling and scalability.
Category 3: Data Access with Spring Boot
These questions test your knowledge of how Spring Boot simplifies database interactions.
1. Q: Explain Spring Data JPA. How does it simplify database operations in Spring Boot?
A: Spring Data JPA is a sub-project of Spring Data that provides an abstraction layer over JPA (Java Persistence API) providers like Hibernate. It significantly simplifies data access layer development by reducing boilerplate code for common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
How it simplifies:
 * Repository Interfaces: You define simple interfaces (e.g., UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long>). Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation at runtime.
 * Convention over Configuration: Common methods like save(), findById(), findAll(), delete() are automatically provided by extending JpaRepository (or CrudRepository, PagingAndSortingRepository).
 * Derived Query Methods: You can define custom query methods just by naming them correctly, e.g., findByEmail(String email), findByLastNameContaining(String name). Spring Data JPA parses the method name and generates the appropriate JPA query.
 * Less Boilerplate: No need to write DAOs, EntityManager boilerplate, or manually manage transactions for basic operations (Spring handles transaction management).
 * Pagination & Sorting: Built-in support for pagination and sorting in queries.
2. Q: What is the difference between JdbcTemplate and Spring Data JPA? When would you use each?
A:
 * JdbcTemplate:
   * What it is: A lower-level abstraction over JDBC. It handles resource management (connections, statements, result sets) and error handling, allowing you to write clean SQL queries.
   * When to use:
     * You need fine-grained control over SQL queries.
     * Performance is absolutely critical, and you want to avoid ORM overhead.
     * Working with complex, database-specific SQL features.
     * Batch operations for high-volume data inserts/updates.
     * You're integrating with an existing legacy database schema that doesn't map well to objects.
   * Pros: Full SQL control, less overhead than JPA, good for complex queries/batch updates.
   * Cons: More boilerplate (you still write SQL), less object-oriented, mapping results to objects is manual.
 * Spring Data JPA:
   * What it is: A higher-level abstraction over JPA (ORM frameworks like Hibernate). It maps Java objects directly to database tables.
   * When to use:
     * You prioritize developer productivity and faster development.
     * Your domain model maps well to relational tables (or you're doing greenfield development).
     * You need to perform standard CRUD operations frequently.
     * You benefit from object-oriented persistence and don't want to write SQL.
   * Pros: Highly productive, reduces boilerplate, object-oriented, database-agnostic (to an extent), good for complex object graphs.
   * Cons: Potential for performance issues if not used carefully (N+1 selects, lazy loading issues), less control over generated SQL, learning curve for JPA/Hibernate concepts.
Conclusion: For typical business applications, Spring Data JPA is often preferred for its productivity. JdbcTemplate is used when specific performance optimizations or complex SQL interactions are required, often alongside JPA in the same application.
3. Q: How do you configure a custom DataSource in Spring Boot?
A: By default, Spring Boot auto-configures a DataSource if it finds database drivers on the classpath and relevant spring.datasource.* properties. To configure a custom DataSource (e.g., for specific pooling properties, or multiple data sources):
Method 1: In application.properties (Most common for a single custom DataSource)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
# HikariCP specific properties (default pooling library)
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000

Spring Boot will pick these up and configure HikariCP (default pooling) accordingly.
Method 2: Programmatically (for advanced scenarios or multiple DataSources)
You can define @Bean methods that return DataSource objects. When you define your own DataSource bean, Spring Boot's auto-configuration backs off.
@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {

    @Bean
    @Primary // Mark this as the primary DataSource if you have multiple
    @ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.main") // Prefix for properties
    public DataSource mainDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }

    // Example of a second DataSource
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.analytics")
    public DataSource analyticsDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
}

And in application.properties:
app.datasource.main.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/maindb
app.datasource.main.username=mainuser
app.datasource.main.password=mainpass
app.datasource.main.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

app.datasource.analytics.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/analyticsdb
app.datasource.analytics.username=analyticsuser
app.datasource.analytics.password=analyticspass
app.datasource.analytics.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

This approach gives you full control over the DataSource type (e.g., HikariDataSource, BasicDataSource).
Category 4: RESTful APIs and Web Development
Crucial for any modern application.
1. Q: How do you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot REST API?
A: Spring Boot provides several mechanisms for robust exception handling in REST APIs:
 * @ResponseStatus on Custom Exception:
   Define a custom exception and annotate it with @ResponseStatus to automatically map it to an HTTP status code.
   @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
// In Controller: throw new ResourceNotFoundException("User not found");

 * @ExceptionHandler in Controller:
   Handle specific exceptions within a single controller.
   @RestController
public class MyController {
    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public ErrorResponse handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse(ex.getMessage(), 404);
    }
}

 * @ControllerAdvice / @RestControllerAdvice (Recommended for Global Handling):
   A centralized, global exception handler that applies across multiple (or all) controllers.
   @RestControllerAdvice // For REST APIs, automatically adds @ResponseBody
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public ErrorResponse handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse(ex.getMessage(), 404);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
    public Map<String, String> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>();
        ex.getBindingResult().getAllErrors().forEach((error) -> {
            String fieldName = ((FieldError) error).getField();
            String errorMessage = error.getDefaultMessage();
            errors.put(fieldName, errorMessage);
        });
        return errors;
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class) // Catch-all for unexpected errors
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
    public ErrorResponse handleGenericException(Exception ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse("An unexpected error occurred", 500);
    }
}

   This is the most flexible and scalable approach for building robust REST APIs.
2. Q: What is @RestController? How does it differ from @Controller?
A:
 * @Controller:
   * A Spring MVC annotation used to mark a class as a controller, primarily for handling web requests and returning views (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf templates) or ModelAndView objects.
   * Methods within a @Controller typically return a String which represents the name of a view.
   * If you want to return a response directly in the body (e.g., JSON/XML), you would need to add @ResponseBody to individual methods or the class.
 * @RestController:
   * A convenience annotation introduced in Spring 4, which is essentially a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody.
   * It's specifically designed for building RESTful web services.
   * When you use @RestController, all methods within the class automatically serialize their return value directly into the HTTP response body (e.g., JSON or XML, based on the content type negotiation), without attempting to resolve a view.
In short:
 * @Controller is for traditional MVC applications that render views.
 * @RestController is for building REST APIs that return data directly.
3. Q: How would you validate incoming request data in a Spring Boot REST API?
A: Spring Boot leverages Bean Validation API (JSR 380), often implemented by Hibernate Validator, for data validation.
Steps:
 * Add Validation Dependency: Ensure spring-boot-starter-validation (which transitively includes Hibernate Validator) is in your pom.xml.
   <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>

 * Add Validation Annotations to DTO/Entity: Apply annotations like @NotNull, @NotEmpty, @Size, @Min, @Max, @Email, @Pattern to fields in your request DTOs.
   ```java
   public class UserRequest {
   @NotEmpty(message = "Username cannot be empty")
   @Size(min = 3, max = 20, message = "Username must be between 3 and 20 characters")
   private String username;
   @Email(message = "Email should be valid")
   @NotEmpty(message = "Email cannot be empty")
   private String email;
   @Min(value = 18, message = "Age must be at least 18")
   private int age;
   // getters, setters, etc.
   }
   ```
 * Enable Validation in Controller: Use @Valid (or @Validated for group validation) on the @RequestBody in your controller method.
   java @PostMapping("/users") public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserRequest userRequest) { // If validation fails, a MethodArgumentNotValidException will be thrown // which can be handled by @ControllerAdvice return ResponseEntity.ok("User created successfully"); } 
 * Handle MethodArgumentNotValidException Globally: Use @ControllerAdvice to catch MethodArgumentNotValidException and return meaningful error messages to the client (as shown in the exception handling example above).
4. Q: What is the purpose of CORS and how can you configure it in Spring Boot?
A: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. It prevents malicious scripts from accessing resources on other domains without permission.
Why needed: If your frontend (e.g., React app) is served from http://localhost:3000 and your Spring Boot backend is running on http://localhost:8080, the browser will block requests from the frontend to the backend by default due to the same-origin policy. CORS provides a way for the server to explicitly permit cross-origin requests.
Configuration in Spring Boot:
 * Method 1: @CrossOrigin Annotation (for specific controllers/methods):
   @RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000") // Allow requests from this origin
public class ProductController {
    // ...
}

   Or on a specific method:
   @PostMapping
@CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:3000", "http://another-domain.com"})
public ResponseEntity<Product> createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
    // ...
}

 * Method 2: Global CORS Configuration (Recommended for application-wide policies):
   Define a WebMvcConfigurer bean to configure CORS globally.
   @Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/api/**") // Apply CORS to all paths under /api/
                .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000", "https://your-frontend-domain.com") // Specific allowed origins
                .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS") // Allowed HTTP methods
                .allowedHeaders("*") // Allowed request headers
                .allowCredentials(true) // Allow sending cookies/auth headers
                .maxAge(3600); // How long the pre-flight response can be cached
    }
}

   This provides more granular control and is better for managing CORS across your entire API.
Category 5: Testing Spring Boot Applications
Infosys emphasizes quality and testing.
1. Q: How do you write unit tests for Spring Boot applications? What annotations are useful for testing?
A: Unit tests focus on testing individual components (e.g., services, repositories) in isolation, without involving the Spring context or external dependencies like databases.
Useful Annotations:
 * @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) or @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) (JUnit 5): For enabling Mockito mocking framework.
 * @Mock: To create mock objects for dependencies (e.g., a UserRepository in a UserService test).
 * @InjectMocks: To inject the mocks into the actual object under test.
Example (Testing a Service):
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import com.example.demo.repository.UserRepository;
import com.example.demo.service.UserService;
import com.example.demo.model.User;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // For JUnit 5
public class UserServiceTest {

    @Mock // Mock the dependency
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @InjectMocks // Inject mocks into this service
    private UserService userService;

    private User testUser;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        testUser = new User(1L, "testuser", "test@example.com");
    }

    @Test
    void testGetUserById_Success() {
        when(userRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(testUser));

        User foundUser = userService.getUserById(1L);

        assertNotNull(foundUser);
        assertEquals("testuser", foundUser.getUsername());
        verify(userRepository, times(1)).findById(1L); // Verify interaction
    }

    @Test
    void testGetUserById_NotFound() {
        when(userRepository.findById(2L)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());

        User foundUser = userService.getUserById(2L);

        assertNull(foundUser); // Or assertThrows(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
        verify(userRepository, times(1)).findById(2L);
    }
}

2. Q: How do you write integration tests for Spring Boot applications? What is the role of @SpringBootTest?
A: Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components, often involving the full Spring context and potentially real external dependencies (or in-memory versions).
@SpringBootTest:
 * This is the primary annotation for integration tests in Spring Boot.
 * It boots up a full Spring ApplicationContext, allowing you to inject beans just like in a real application.
 * It can start an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) at a random port for testing HTTP endpoints.
 * It can be configured to load specific parts of the context or use specific profiles.
Useful Annotations:
 * @AutoConfigureMockMvc: Used with @SpringBootTest to auto-configure MockMvc, which allows you to perform HTTP requests without actually starting a server (it mocks the servlet environment).
 * @WebMvcTest: A specialized test slice annotation for testing only the web layer (@Controller, @RestController, @ControllerAdvice). It auto-configures MockMvc and limits the beans loaded to only web-related components. Much faster than @SpringBootTest for web tests.
 * @DataJpaTest: Specialized for testing Spring Data JPA repositories. It configures an in-memory database and scans for @Entity and Spring Data JPA repositories.
 * @MockBean: To add mocks to the Spring ApplicationContext for specific beans (e.g., mock an external service call).
Example (Testing a REST Controller with MockMvc):
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.*;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import com.example.demo.model.User;
import com.example.demo.service.UserService;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;

@WebMvcTest(UserController.class) // Test only the UserController
public class UserControllerIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockBean // Mock the service layer dependency
    private UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper; // To convert objects to JSON

    @Test
    void testGetUserById_Success() throws Exception {
        User mockUser = new User(1L, "testuser", "test@example.com");
        when(userService.getUserById(1L)).thenReturn(mockUser);

        mockMvc.perform(get("/api/users/1")
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.username").value("testuser"))
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.email").value("test@example.com"));

        verify(userService, times(1)).getUserById(1L);
    }

    @Test
    void testCreateUser_Success() throws Exception {
        User newUser = new User(null, "newuser", "new@example.com");
        User savedUser = new User(2L, "newuser", "new@example.com"); // Simulate save
        when(userService.createUser(any(User.class))).thenReturn(savedUser);

Category 6: Advanced Spring Boot & General Spring Concepts
These cover broader Spring knowledge applied within a Boot context.
1. Q: What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller?
A: These are Spring stereotype annotations used to mark a class as a Spring-managed component, making it eligible for component scanning and dependency injection. While functionally similar (they all make a class a Spring bean), they serve different semantic purposes and enable specific features:
 * @Component: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It's the base annotation.
 * @Service: Marks a class in the service layer, indicating it holds business logic. It's a specialization of @Component. Provides better readability and might be targeted by AOP aspects for transaction management or logging.
 * @Repository: Marks a class in the data access layer (DAO), indicating it's responsible for interacting with a database. It's a specialization of @Component. It also provides automatic translation of database-specific exceptions into Spring's unchecked DataAccessException hierarchy.
 * @Controller: Marks a class as a web controller in the Spring MVC layer, handling incoming web requests and preparing a model to be returned to a view (as discussed before, @RestController is for REST APIs). It's a specialization of @Component.
Why use specialized annotations?
 * Readability/Clarity: Clearly indicates the role of the component.
 * Semantic Meaning: Helps tools and frameworks understand the architecture.
 * AOP Scanners: Allow tools (like Spring's data access exception translation for @Repository) or custom Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) aspects to specifically target these layers.
2. Q: Explain Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring. Why are they important?
A:
 * Inversion of Control (IoC): This is a fundamental principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is inverted from the application code to a framework (the Spring IoC container). Instead of your code explicitly creating dependencies (new SomeClass()), the container instantiates, configures, and assembles the objects.
   * Importance: Reduces coupling, makes components more modular, easier to test (mocks can be injected).
 * Dependency Injection (DI): This is a specific implementation of IoC. It's the process of providing external dependencies to a software component. Instead of the component creating its dependencies, the dependencies are "injected" into it by the IoC container.
   * Types of DI in Spring:
     * Constructor Injection (Recommended): Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
       @Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyRepository myRepository;
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) { // Dependency injected here
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
}

     * Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided via setter methods.
     * Field Injection (Least Recommended): Dependencies are injected directly into fields using @Autowired.
       @Service
public class MyService {
    @Autowired // Field injection (discouraged)
    private MyRepository myRepository;
}

   * Importance:
     * Loose Coupling: Components are not tightly bound to their dependencies.
     * Testability: Easy to inject mock dependencies for unit testing.
     * Maintainability: Easier to change dependencies without modifying the component's internal code.
     * Reusability: Components become more generic and reusable.
3. Q: What is AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) in Spring? Give an example of its use.
A: AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. Cross-cutting concerns are functionalities that span multiple points of an application and are often difficult to modularize (e.g., logging, security, transaction management, caching).
Key AOP Concepts:
 * Aspect: A modularization of a cross-cutting concern (e.g., a logging aspect, a security aspect).
 * Join Point: A specific point during the execution of a program (e.g., method execution, exception handling).
 * Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point (e.g., "log before method execution").
   * @Before: Before the join point.
   * @After: After the join point (regardless of success or failure).
   * @AfterReturning: After the join point returns normally.
   * @AfterThrowing: After the join point throws an exception.
   * @Around: Around the join point (can control execution).
 * Pointcut: A predicate that matches join points (e.g., "all methods in com.example.service package").
 * Weaving: The process of linking aspects with other objects to create the advised object. Spring AOP typically uses proxy-based AOP (runtime weaving).
Example (Logging with AOP):
@Aspect // Mark as an Aspect
@Component // Make it a Spring bean
@Slf4j
public class LoggingAspect {

    // Pointcut: all public methods in any class within com.example.service package
    @Pointcut("execution(public * com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    private void serviceMethods() {}

    @Before("serviceMethods()") // Advice: execute before service methods
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        log.info("Entering method: {}.{}() with args: {}",
                joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringTypeName(),
                joinPoint.getSignature().getName(),
                Arrays.toString(joinPoint.getArgs()));
    }

    @AfterReturning(pointcut = "serviceMethods()", returning = "result")
    public void logAfterReturning(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object result) {
        log.info("Exiting method: {}.{}() with result: {}",
                joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringTypeName(),
                joinPoint.getSignature().getName(),
                result);
    }

    @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "serviceMethods()", throwing = "exception")
    public void logAfterThrowing(JoinPoint joinPoint, Throwable exception) {
        log.error("Exception in method: {}.{}() with cause: {}",
                  joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringTypeName(),
                  joinPoint.getSignature().getName(),
                  exception.getMessage());
    }
}

To enable AOP, typically add @EnableAspectJAutoProxy to your main application class or a configuration class.
Common use cases: Transaction management (@Transactional), security checks, caching, logging, performance monitoring.
4. Q: How does Spring Boot handle database migrations (e.g., using Flyway or Liquibase)?
A: Spring Boot provides excellent auto-configuration for popular database migration tools like Flyway and Liquibase. This is crucial in production environments to manage schema changes and keep database versions aligned with application versions.
General approach:
 * Add Dependency: Include flyway-core or liquibase-core in your pom.xml.
   xml <dependency> <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId> <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.liquibase</groupId> <artifactId>liquibase-core</artifactId> </dependency> 
 * Migration Scripts: Place your SQL migration scripts (for Flyway) or XML/YAML/JSON changelog files (for Liquibase) in the default locations:
   * Flyway: src/main/resources/db/migration/ (e.g., V1__create_users_table.sql, V2__add_products_table.sql)
   * Liquibase: src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml (or .xml, .json)
 * Spring Boot Auto-configuration: When the application starts, Spring Boot detects the migration library, scans for scripts in the default location, and automatically applies any pending migrations to the configured DataSource. It manages the schema versioning internally (e.g., flyway_schema_history table for Flyway, databasechangelog/databasechangeloglock for Liquibase).
Configuration in application.properties (Optional, for customization):
# Flyway specific properties
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.url=${spring.datasource.url} # Uses main datasource by default
spring.flyway.user=${spring.datasource.username}
spring.flyway.password=${spring.datasource.password}
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true # Useful for existing databases
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:/db/migration # Custom location if needed

# Liquibase specific properties
# spring.liquibase.enabled=true
# spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml

Benefits:
 * Version Control: Database schema changes are versioned and can be managed like code.
 * Reproducibility: Ensures consistent database schemas across environments.
 * Automated Deployment: Migrations are applied automatically on application startup.
 * Collaboration: Facilitates team collaboration on database changes.
General Tips for Infosys Interviews:
 * Be Prepared for Scenario-Based Questions: Infosys often asks "How would you design X?" or "How would you solve Y problem in a distributed environment?" Relate your answers to the core principles (scalability, resilience, fault tolerance, decoupling).
 * Emphasize Best Practices: Talk about clean code, SOLID principles, testing (unit, integration), CI/CD, logging, monitoring.
 * Demonstrate Problem-Solving: If you don't know an answer, don't just say "I don't know." Explain your thought process, what concepts you'd look into, or how you'd approach finding the solution.
 * Show Understanding of the "Why": Don't just list features; explain why a particular feature or pattern is beneficial and what problem it solves.
 * Be Aware of Spring Cloud: Given Infosys's focus on enterprise and cloud solutions, a good understanding of Spring Cloud components (Eureka, Config, Gateway, Resilience4j, Sleuth) is highly valuable.
 * Discuss Experience: Whenever possible, relate your answers to your past project experiences. "In my previous project, we used Spring Data JPA for X, and for Y complex queries, we resorted to JdbcTemplate for performance."
This comprehensive set of questions and answers should give you a very strong foundation for a Spring Boot interview at Infosys. Good luck!
